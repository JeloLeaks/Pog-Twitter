# Pog Twitter 
*(didnt have any ideas for the name)*
Pog Twitter is my project that I have been working on which allows you to tweet with a custom Source Label **(the thing that is under the tweet)** which is possible but many people had a problem with tweeting a picture/video using python or whatever they used. This changes **everything**. Kapp

# Installation
Go to [Releases](https://github.com/JeloLeaks/PogTwitter/releases/).

Dude there is no way you dont know how to download, extract and run the app.

# Creating Twitter app (Twitter did something and new created apps don't show the source labels)

* Go to [Twitter Developers](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps)
* Then they will probably ask you to apply for a **Developer** account unless you already did before.
* Once approved, you can create an app using the link above and here is an example of how you should fill in all of the information:

App name is the source label btw.

* After you filled in all the required information and created the app you should now see three buttons, one of them is "Keys and tokens", press it.

* You will see your **API Keys** and **Access Tokens** copy and paste them into **Pog Twitter** and press the blue button **Update**.

Everything should be now working, tweet something and check if it appears on your profile!
**If it doesn't work **PLEASE** create a new Issue!**
