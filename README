# Pog Twitter 
*(didnt have any ideas for the name)*
Pog Twitter is my project that I have been working on which allows you to tweet with a custom Source Label **(the thing that is under the tweet)** which is possible but many people had a problem with tweeting a picture/video using python or whatever they used. This changes **everything**. Kapp

# Installation
Go to ![Releases](https://github.com/JeloLeaks/PogTwitter/releases/).

Dude there is no way you dont know how to download, extract and run the app.
